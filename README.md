**Hand Gesture**
---
Small tools to visualize how you can use your own hand gestures to interact with your computer. 

*The following can be tried out:*

 - Scrolling up and down by opening and closing fist
 - Volume control by pinching fingers
 - Mouse movement with pointer finger

*Installation guide*
--- 
The basic requirement is to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) running on your machine and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

    python get-pip.py

I recommend using venv to better manage separate package installations.

    python venv 

Aside for that, all that is needed is to install the required packages then.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
